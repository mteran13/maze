Hopefuly I can do some form of reinforcement training on the npc and then perchance it can have a progressive difficulty.

The only thing is that the mazes are pretty easy to complete so either I need to add some sort of obstacles or just increase the size and make it more complex.

Obstacles/advantages on the maze would be cool it'd be like a sort of pacman thing


issues:
rl agent keeps backtracking the maze path.
i set the frame rate to like 1000 and i could just see it going back and forth
