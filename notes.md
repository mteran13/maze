***PLZ IGNORE ALL THE WEIRD FILES AND CODE THIS PROJECT IS VERY EXPERIMENTAL

Hopefuly I can continue doing some form of reinforcement training on the npc and then perchance it can have a progressive difficulty?
  Deep RL can be difficult to program in the way this matrix is set up tho

Obstacles/advantages on the maze would be cool it'd be like a sort of pacman thing? Plus it can add variability instead of just being simple and kinda boring


issues:
rl agent keeps backtracking the maze path.
i set the frame rate to like 1000 and i could just see it going back and forth

need to train it better? still learning rl
